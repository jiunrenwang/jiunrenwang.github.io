When I made the decision to go back to school to earn a degree, I wanted to take a moment and assess my situation. A lot had changed since I last stepped in a college classroom. It had been about *15* years since I've taken a college class. Okay, that means some (most) of the classes I've taken probably wouldn't transfer. And I'm sure a lot of the methods and concepts have been updated. Oh, and now I'm married. And my co-worker/HR supervisor is our 3 year toddler that has more energy than I do. So, maybe signing up for 16 credit hours in my first semester is not the smart move.

Now what?

Well, there seems to be a lot of online programs now that offer credit and non-credit courses to gain knowledge, skills, and just a different way of learning. Hmm...this sounds interesting. I can learn at my own pace, but still have deadlines for assignments as a motivation to not waste time. This might be a viable path. But this leads to another question. Which online program to choose? I'm going to go over the three main programs I considered, the pros and cons of each, and why I chose the one I did.

1. Udacity - The programs offered here looked great. It was very easy to find information about the different programs and what kind of teaching and training they would provide. Unforutnately, their offering seemed a bit out of reach for me. It was a bit more expensive than I was willing to pay in order to "get my feet wet". I liked their emphasis on promoting projects as a way for the learner to build out their portfolio and to give practical examples of how to translate what you learn into something you can share with the world.
2. Udemy - There were so many options on here. Quite a variety of topics covered and they offer courses about the same topics at different experience levels. This was very appealing to me. Just didn't quite have enough confidence to navigate through all of the skill levels to figure out which program would've worked for me.
3. Coursera - Coursera offered a lot of courses that were very similar to classes offered at the schools I was considering to complete my degree. They had a lot of programs that could offere certifications and career counseling and networking after completion. Quite a few of the courses were eligible to be transferred to schools for college credit. You could even pursue a BS or MS degree through Coursera, if that's what you wanted to do.

With all of those built in benefits I ultimately chose to take a course on Coursera. I was able to complete the course and gain a certification fairly quickly. The advisors were very helpful in pointing me in the right direction if I got stuck on a problem. But it never felt like hand holding. I even got a few job offers within 4 weeks of completing the certificate. After spending the previous 10 months as a stay at home parent, it was a big boost to get that kind of resopnse so quickly.

I hope my experience with choosing an online learning program can help someone who's searching a way to continue to learn and progress. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Until next time.
