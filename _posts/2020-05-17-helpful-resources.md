As I started to do some preliminary research on how to prepare myself to learn
a whole new field, I realized that I need help. The wonderful thing about learning
to code is the fact that there are so many resources out there. The terrifying
thing is, *there are so many resources out there*. But what gave me hope was to
see such a wide and diverse community that tries to help the community with all
of their varied talents. Some write great deep dive walkthrough about a feature
that they love. Someone else might create a podcast. Another person might make
a series of YouTube videos. Whatever the format, they share their knowledge and
passion. And by sharing that passion they inspire a new generation of learners
everyday. For that I am thankful.

This list isn't filled with exclusively tech or coding resources. They're people
or projects that have oftentimes given me a pearl of wisdom, a technique I can
practice or a unique voice that inspires me to try harder and not quit. So, here
we go:

1. [freecodecamp](https://freecodecamp.org) - this site is filled with many wonderful people that have
given so generously to teach, inspire, and motivate others to learn about code.
2. [codecademy](https://codecademy.com) - I still trip up over the name when I tell my friends and
family about this site. Great lessons, good pacing, and lots of practical examples
to hone your skills. The year long subscription was definitely worth it for me.
3. [ezra klein show](https://vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast) - Ezra Klein has a great talent for engaging
with another person in a conversation. He breaks down these complex topics and
has a real conversation. I hope that some of what I write might inspire others
to engage in great conversation.
4. [blizzardwatch](https://blizzardwatch.com) - Blizzard games have had a big impact on me over the years.
And the folks at BW have gone through some major adversity and overcome some
big obstacles. It's really impressive to read about their journey and how they
became not only a team of coworkers but a family.
5. [dev.to](https://dev.to) - This is the site that really convinced me to write a blog. There's
a lot of great technical information here, but it's greatest asset is this
great community they've built. They write, they encourage, and they share this
wonderful passion of their craft.

I think 5 is enough for a start. I hope you find these resources to be as
helpful to you as they have been for me. Have a great day.
