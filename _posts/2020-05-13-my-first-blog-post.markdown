Hi there,

My name is Jiun Ren Wang. A couple of years ago was a big milestone moment for me. Our family picked up our lives and moved across the country to make a new start in the Bay Area. As my wife got settled into her new job, I had the opportunity to learn to be a stay-at-home dad to our little boy. Definitely one of the most challenging, yet rewarding, jobs I've ever had in my life. This gave me the opportunity to spend a lot of time with our little boy during his toddler years and time to reflect on what I wanted to do with my life.

After a lot of consideration, I decided that I wanted to go back to school and complete my degree. But this decision led to a lot more questions. What degree should I get? How do we pay for it? Do I have enough time? Do I have enough time? I realized a lot of the questions I came up with came from a place of self-doubt. Thankfully, my wife and our friends and family were very supportive and encouraged me to press forward.

Now, I hope to use this blog to help document my learning journey for myself and anyone who might want to read it as a tool for reflection and encouragement.

Thank you for following along so far.
